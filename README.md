### Design Pattern

* _Module & Constructor Pattern_

I used, to this assigntment, a module pattern in order to put all functions together in a container (module). I was actually thinking to use two modules to separate functions of "input" from another of "output", however, some functions co-work together with other functions to get one result, and I also found it was meaningless to separate in two different modules, so eventually, I put all functions to one module. However, I still have a construction pattern outside of the module to create an instance of movie.
