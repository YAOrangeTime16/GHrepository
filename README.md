### Design Pattern

* Module Pattern
I used, to this assigntment, a module pattern in order to put all functions together in a container (module). I was actually thinking to use two modules to separate functions to "input" and another to "output", however, some functions co-work together with another function to get one result and I also found it was meaningless to use two different modules, so eventually, I put all functions to one module. However, I still have a construction pattern outside of the module to create an instance of movie.
