Module | Constructor
------------ | -------------
Easy to find a target function
--- by just looking inside at```return {}``` | outside of the module to create an instance of a movie


**Asking for your advice**
There is tripple for-loops in the ```getByGenre``` function. Can you advise me how to fix them with filter() or map().
